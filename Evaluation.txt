Pg. 1:
    * Why not test SPEC on micro instance?
    * What are the specs of your laptop?

Pg. 2:
    * Here it says that LB gets node list by messages from coordination, whereas
      on pg. 6 you say that LB polls coordinator. 

Pg. 3:
    * I would like a reference to where I can read more about the instance types
      and their specs.

Pg. 4 Graph:
    * Why is there a line between the instances? Is there a linear trend
      of instances between the dots?
    * Is this one sample? What is the standard deviation?
    * Why does the Y-axis start at 2?

Pg.6:
    * It is not clear to me if the evaluation is of your or amazon's
      loadbalancer.
    * Either which it is I miss benchmark data of the other.
    * Why do you need internal implementation to compare two load balancers?
    * Here you use mean value, it means nothing without some info about variance
     and expected distribution.

Pg. 7:
    * Good, there is a function deferToThread which is awesome for dealing with
      syncronous libraries like boto. You can then add this to a "master"
      deferred and it works like a fork/join.
